# python_project_SS

This repository contains a final project for the course 'Python for Biologists'.

The goal of this project is to create an easier workflow to analyze manual mating assays. 


## Colony counting

### Input files

When spotting onto the selective plates, do so according to the pattern provided on [layout_reference].

After performing a liquid mating assay, plates should be scanned using a ChemiDoc imaging system/ordinary tabletop scanner (decide!), and saved as a [filetype].

When naming the image files, do so according to the following pattern: **date_environment-strain-control_environment-strain-sample_D-or-T**, with D indicating Donor selecting plates and T indicating Transconjugant selecting plates.

### Script

### Output

  Information about how to use the script.

This script will output a .csv file containing four columns, showing date, condition (strain, environment, replicate), colony count, and dilution at which this colony count was obtained.
